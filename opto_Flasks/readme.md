# Opto Flasks
To illuminate flasks (250 mL flasks used in the study). </br>

___
**Illumination stands construction**: </br>

The illuination stand is made of 2 nested petri dishes (a.), a slightly bigger one to encase the electronics components (base + lid), a slighty smaller one where holes are drilled to hold LEDs in place (base only - c.). All petri dish parts are cut for a power socket to be positioned on the outside of the plates (b., c.).</br></br>

In practice, LEDs are connected (soldered) via their leads (long and short) in series of four (e., f.), and only a few wires are needed to connect to the power socket (g., h.). </br></br>

Once the bases are nested, the lid is put on (i.).  There, using black tape, everyting is held tight together (j.).</br></br>

___
**SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE S3:** </br>
A number of LEDs are arranged in circle to line up with the rotating medium in a shaking incubator. </br>
LEDs are arranged in series of 4 so that each receives 20mA. </br></br>

Flasks are placed on top of those illumination stands and held together in metallic holders + lab tape.  </br></br>
