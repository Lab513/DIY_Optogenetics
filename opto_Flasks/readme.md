# Opto Flasks
To illuminate flasks (250 mL flasks used in the study). </br>

___
**Illumination stands construction**: </br>

Made of 2 nested petri dishes, a slightly bigger one to encase the electronics components (base + lid), a slighty smaller one where holes are drilled to hold LEDs in place (base only). All petri dish parts are cut for a power socket to be positioned on the outside of the plates.</br></br>

In practice, LEDs are connected (soldered) via their leads (long and short), and only a few wires are needed to connect to the power socket.</br></br>

Once the bases are nested, the lid is put on.  There, using black tape, everyting is held tight together.

___
**SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE S3:** </br>
A number of LEDs are arranged in circle to line up with the rotating medium in a shaking incubator. </br>
LEDs are arranged in series of 4 so that each receives 20mA. </br></br>

Flasks are placed on top of those illumination stands and held together in metallic holders + lab tape.  </br></br>
